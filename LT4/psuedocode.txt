    If (position is not empty):
        - If market depth is still positive with a margin, reinput limit orders
        - else place market order (or limit orders below market)

    if (have tender offer):
        - If have position in the opposite direction, subtract that from tender offer
            - Check market depth

market vs limit:
    - Check ticker 
        - if less than 25 seconds left create market orders
    - If market depth is not over margin, place market orders
    - If bid ask spread is small, place market orders
    
    

create market orders:
    - Place limit under market so they get filled but don't get screwed over by disappearing liquidity
